            <h2>Has rock really changed that much?</h2>
            <p>Rock music has been around since the late 1940s and its history 
            is rich and complex. The earliest versions of rock are barely recognizable
            as the same genre of music as rock that came out fifteen years later, let alone
            rock from thirty or even sixty years later. While it has changed significantly,
            rock is still around today and today's rock still takes a huge influence 
            from earlier versions of rock.</p>

            <h3>The 40s and 50s</h3>
            <img id="alan_freed" src="images/alan_freed.jpg" alt="Alan Freed Picture"/>
            <p>Rock started off with very structured songs that were heavily influenced
            by the blues. This era of rock is often referred to as 'rock and roll' which
            is a term that a Alan Freed, a disc jockey from the time, used to refer to
            the early versions of rock music. Rock and roll caught on quickly with the 
            youth because of its controversiality in society. Rock and roll lyrics were
            often about topics that were considered taboo at the time, and the loud
            heavy sounds coupled with the 'inappropriate' dance moves. One of the most
            popular artists of the era, Chuck Berry, is considered to be a huge influence
            for the next wave of rock styles that came around in the 60s.</p>

            <h3>The 60s</h3>
            <img id="beatles" src="images/the_beatles_ed_sulivan.jpg" alt="Beatles image"/>
            <p>Conveniently for the sake of describing it's history, rock music's
            evolution fits fairly well with the turn of each decade. As the 60s rolled 
            around, bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones became popular. 
            The music being produced was more heavily focuses on the themes of rebellion,
            drugs, and sex. Bands also became more popular than solo artists, which allowed 
            musicians to create more cohesive albums. It's popularity at the turn of the
            decade and improvements in recording technology pushed rock music into
            the styles of the 70s.</p>

            <div id="seventies">
            <h3>The 70s</h3>
            <p>The 70s brought with it darker, heavier tones and more experimentation.
            Bands like Led Zeppelin are a good example of the darker, heavier tones
            heard throughout the 70s. On the other hand, heavy experimentation can be 
            heard in bands like Pink Floyd. The music of bands like Pink Floyd often
            had very unique sounds. This was made possible with the improvements 
            in recording technology, which allowed major alterations to recorded music.
            Pink Floyd is probably the most artistically and commercially successful
            bands when it came to this type of music. The other major influence for 
            bands like this was psychedelic drugs. Many rock bands of the time did't like 
            the direction that rock was moving. These bands referred to the psychedelic 
            movement as 'hippie' bands and considered them to be pretentious. So,
            bands like the Sex Pistols and the Clash started the punk movement which was
            marked by loud, heavily distorted guitars and enraged lyrics and vocals.</p>

            <h3>The 80s</h3>
            <img id="eighties_picture" src="images/eighties_fashon.jpg" alt="Eighties Fashion"/>
            <p>Major improvements in technology were allowing bands to create more synthesised   music using computers and new electronic instruments. These improvements
            lead to a much more computerized and electronic sound than was possible in
            in the past. Many bands like Guns N' Roses still wanted to make rock with a 
            heavier more guitar based sound. The other bands; however, ran with the 
            synthetic sound and created what is often referred to as pop rock. These were
            bands like Simple Minds. Their music was typically fairly up beat and good dance music.
            The introduction of MTV also had an effect on the music. MTV brought with
            it the popularization of music videos, which lead up and coming bands to 
            focus on making music they could dance to in order to produce more
            appealing videos.</p>

            <h3>The 90s and on</h3>
            <img id="blink" src="images/blink_182.jpg" alt="Blink-182 Logo image"/>
            <p>By the time the 90s came around, rock was no longer the most popular
            genre of music. This didn't stop musicians from continuing to make
            rock music. The punk movement was one of the most prominent styles of
            rock music. This included bands such as Green Day and Blink-182. More genres 
            emerged in rock as well. These included grunge, indie, and alternative rock,
            as well as many other new variations. Rock has been evolving constantly 
            since it grew out of older genres of music, and it will continue to 
            expand and diversify as more musicians explore this genre of music.
            It is reasonable to expect that rock will never truly die out all the way.</p>
