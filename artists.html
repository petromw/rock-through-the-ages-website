                    <h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0Fnb2pfBfu0ka33d6Yki17"></iframe>
                    <p>Bob Dylan was an essential influence in the popularization of rock
                    music. Throughout the 60s, Dylan's was the voice of revolution. His music
                    called for change in society, which was enticing to the youth and
                    quickly gained a strong following. His music had a folk sound and relied
                    heavily on the lyrics. His songs have likely been remade and covered
                    more than any other artists ever. It would be hard to find someone
                    that has never heard a song by Bob Dylan, or at least a cover by
                    another popular artist, such as Jimi Hendrix or Guns N' Roses.</p>

                    <p>Jimi Hendrix is arguable one of the most influential artists in
                    rock history. He is also regarded by many to be one of the most 
                    talented guitarists of all time. He demonstrated the extent to which
                    a guitar can be used as an instrument, which lead to experimentation
                    by other artist and developments in musical style. His music relied 
                    heavily on distorted guitar and instrumental sounds. He was very 
                    experimental with his sound and while his career was very short he
                    was, and still is, one of the most popular rock artists of all time.</p>

                    <p>The Beatles were made up of four members: John Lennon, Paul 
                    McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Together they made
                    up one of the most well known bands to have ever produced music.
                    Throughout their career, they recorded a couple hundred songs, and 
                    sold almost two hundred million albums. They were extremely successful
                    both commercially and artistically. The Beatles have a huge variety of 
                    styles of music because they were constantly experimenting with new sounds.
                    Their sounds vary from old rock and roll to very psychedelic sounds.</p>

                    <p>Pink Floyd is a band with a fascinating history. In the band's
                        early days, the original singer and front-man, Syd Barrett,
                    started the bands trend of experimental, psychedelic music and
                    cohesive concept albums. For each album, Pink Floyd viewed them as a 
                    project. Almost all of their albums were concept albums, which means
                    that they have a message, theme, or story throughout all of the songs
                    on the album. Their albums were also linked by musical motifs which makes
                    them easy to follow and enjoyable to listen to all the way through. Pink Floyd
                    experimented with a lot of sounds and each album has it's own 
                    unique style. The tone of each album is consistent with the
                    message they were trying to convey.</p>

                    <h4>Bruce Springsteen</h4>
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/56lhDZNQ5J47aog6mGKeGk"></iframe>
                    <p>Bruce Springsteen, aka "The Boss", was a huge success with 
                    audiences of all backgrounds, although he cared most about the
                    American working class. Springsteen grew up in a working class 
                    family with limited income, and he did not have a good relationship
                    with his father. His childhood had a huge influence on his music.
                    Springsteen is a both story teller and a musician at heart. He took
                    these two talents and developed his style of music, which is, at
                    it's core, stories set to music. Springsteen's sound is influenced
                    by rock and roll and folk rock. He has a distinct deep gravelly voice
                    and a powerful rock sound. His music is complimented by his band,
                    but most importantly Clarence Clemons who was his saxophonist
                    and good friend.</p>

                    <h4>Led Zeppelin</h4>
                    <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2nVHqZbOGkKWzlcy1aMbE7"></iframe>
                    <p>Led Zeppelin is the sound that most people think of when they 
                    hear 'classic rock'. They have a blues influenced sound but it 
                    is much more electric and fast. They rely heavily on guitars
                    and drums. Led Zeppelin has some of the most recognizable songs
                    ever written. They were a huge part of the classic rock movement
                    and still have a vast following to this day even though they no
                    longer make music. Zeppelin's songs are distinguishable by long guitar
                    solos and heavy lyrics.</p>
