            <h2>A brief description of me and this website</h2>
            <p>My name is Mark Petro. I am a student in the Information Technology
            program at the University of Cincinnati on the software development
            track. This is a website I designed for my 'Fundamentals of Web Development'
            course. The purpose of this site is to demonstrate my skills with basic
            web development.</p>
            <p>I have always had a passion for music even though I possess no musical
            talent of my own. This is why I love learning about artists and music.
            One of my favorite genres is classic rock. Specifically, I love music
            from the 70s the most. I wanted to create a website that would give me 
            the opportunity to learn more about rock music. While developing this page,
            I was able to build on the knowledge I already had about the history
            of classic rock and the various artists. I included some of my personal
            opinions where I couldn't find statistics. </p>
